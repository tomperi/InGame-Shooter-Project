## InGame PvP Shooter
This game was developed as a part of the IDC InGame course, and we named it Unburied Fugies (for no real reason). It is a player vs player scrollless shooter, played on a single keyboard. Every time a monster hits you or your side of the wall, causes the wall to move and shrinks the gap between you and the monsters. Random bonus and mega-monsters spice up the play every now and then.

The goal - eliminate as many monsters before reaching the end of the screen!
